Olds Theory: Exotic Energy Conduits & Sub-Planckian Logic

"We don't need faster switches; we need smarter carriers."

Current electronics are hitting a thermal wall. We have optimized the electron to its absolute limit, yet we still lose 98% of our potential to heat. This repository contains the open-source framework for a post-silicon era of physics.

The Olds Theory introduces the "Olds Principle" of Information-Energy Equivalence, proposing the use of composite Baryons (Protons) as integrated logic-power carriers to reclaim computational entropy and bypass the Landauer Limit.

🚀 The Core Postulates

The Olds Principle: Information is a state of energy. By encoding logic in the flavor-states of Baryons, we utilize the "State-Shift Dividend" to reclaim energy that would otherwise be lost to heat.

Exotic Conduits: A new infrastructure using composite particle streams capable of simultaneous power delivery and multi-state logic.

Sub-Planckian Logic: Utilizing the "Quantum Foam" of space-time as a non-volatile, infinite-capacity data storage layer.

Olds-Casimir Propulsion: Generating thrust by manipulating vacuum pressure gradients.

⚖️ Open Source Commitment

This work is released into the Public Domain. I invite physicists, engineers, and visionaries to iterate, critique, and build upon these definitions without fear of litigation or patent encumbrance.

Let the "Master Your Potential" movement belong to humanity.
