## ⚡ What Is This?

An **interactive, browser-based physics education platform** featuring 14+ hands-on simulations exploring:
- Baryonic computing (alternative to electron-based systems)
- Exotic energy principles (theoretical framework)
- Quantum mechanics visualizations
- Spacetime dynamics and relativity
- Harmonic resonance and consciousness-field interactions

**Use this to:**
- 🎓 Teach quantum mechanics interactively
- 🔬 Inspire research projects in exotic physics
- 🚀 Spark imagination in STEM students
- 📚 Create engaging classroom demonstrations
